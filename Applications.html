 <h2 style="font-size:20px;">Health care</h2>
  <p>When it comes to saving our lives, a lot of organizations and medical care centers are relying on AI. There are many examples of how AI in healthcare has helped patients all over the world.
     An organization called Cambio Health Care developed a clinical decision support system for stroke prevention that can give the physician a warning when there’s a patient at risk of having a heart stroke.Another such example is Coala life which is a company that has a digitalized device that can find cardiac diseases.
     Similarly, Aifloo is developing a system for keeping track of how people are doing in nursing homes, home care, etc. The best thing about AI in healthcare is that you don’t even need to develop a new medication. Just by using an existing medication in the right way, you can also save lives.</p>

 <h3 style="font-size:20px;">Space exploratiom</h3>
  <p>Space expeditions and discoveries always require analyzing vast amounts of data. Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning is the best way to handle and process data on this scale. After rigorous research, astronomers used Artificial Intelligence to sift through years of data obtained by the Kepler telescope in order to identify a distant eight-planet solar system.
     Artificial Intelligence is also being used for NASA’s next rover mission to Mars, the Mars 2020 Rover. The AEGIS, which is an AI-based Mars rover is already on the red planet. The rover is responsible for autonomous targeting of cameras in order to perform investigations on Mars.</p>

 <h4 style="font-size:20px;">Autonomous vehicles</h4>
  <p> For the longest time, self-driving cars have been a buzzword in the AI industry. The development of autonomous vehicles will definitely revolutionaries the transport system.
      Companies like Waymo conducted several test drives in Phoenix before deploying their first AI-based public ride-hailing service. The AI system collects data from the vehicles radar, cameras, GPS, and cloud services to produce control signals that operate the vehicle.
      Advanced Deep Learning algorithms can accurately predict what objects in the vehicle’s vicinity are likely to do. This makes Waymo cars more effective and safer.
      Another famous example of an autonomous vehicle is Tesla’s self-driving car. Artificial Intelligence implements computer vision, image detection and deep learning to build cars that can automatically detect objects and drive around without human intervention.</p>

 <h5 style="font-size:20px;">Chatbots</h5>
  <p>These days Virtual assistants have become a very common technology. Almost every household has a virtual assistant that controls the appliances at home. A few examples include Siri, Cortana, which are gaining popularity because of the user experience they provide.
     Amazon’s Echo is an example of how Artificial Intelligence can be used to translate human language into desirable actions. This device uses speech recognition and NLP to perform a wide range of tasks on your command. It can do more than just play your favorite songs. It can be used to control the devices at your house, book cabs, make phone calls, order your favorite food, check the weather conditions and so on.
     Another example is the newly released Google’s virtual assistant called Google Duplex, that has astonished millions of people. Not only can it respond to calls and book appointments for you, but it also adds a human touch.</p>
